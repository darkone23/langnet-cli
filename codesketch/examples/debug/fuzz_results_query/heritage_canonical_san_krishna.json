Nanda with his wife Ya\u015bo-d\u0101 took the infant K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and settled first in Gokula or Vraja, and afterwards in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Bala-r\u0101ma grew up together, roaming in the woods and joining in the sports of the herdsmen's sons ; K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a youth contested the sovereignty of Indra, and was victorious over that god, who descended from heaven to praise K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and made him lord over the cattle [Hariv. 3787 ff.; 7456 ff.; VP.]; K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described as sporting constantly with the Gop\u012bs or shepherdesses [Hariv. 4078 ff.; 8301 ff.; VP.; G\u012bt.] of whom a thousand became his wives, though only eight are specified, R\u0101dh\u0101 being the favourite [Hariv. 6694 ff.; 9177 ff.; VP.]; K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a built and fortified a city called Dv\u0101rak\u0101 in Gujar\u0101t, and thither transported the inhabitants of Mathur\u0101 after killing Ka\u1e43sa; K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had various wives besides the Gop\u012bs, and by Rukmi\u1e47\u012b had a son Pradyumna who is usually identified with K\u0101ma-deva; with Jains, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is one of the nine black Vasu-devas; with Buddhists he is the chief of the black demons, who are the enemies of Buddha and the white demons)",

[K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the most celebrated hero of Indian mythology and the most popular of all the deities. Though the real son of Vasudeva and Devak\u012b and thus a cousin of Ka\u1e43sa, he was, for all practical purposes, the son of Nanda and Ya\u015bod\u0101 by whom he was brought up and in whose house he spent his childhood. It was here that his divine character began to be gradually discovered, when he easily crushed the most redoubtable demons, such as Baka, P\u016btan\u0101 &c., that were sent to kill him by Ka\u1e43sa, and performed many other feats of  (pb)  surprising strength. The chief companions of his youth were the Gop\u012bs or wives of the cowherds of Gokula, among whom R\u0101dh\u0101 was his special favourite; (cf. Jayadeva's G\u012btagovinda). He killed Ka\u1e43sa, Naraka, Ke\u015bin, Ari\u1e63\u1e6da and a host of other powerful demons. He was a particular friend of Arjuna, to whom he acted as charioteer in the great war, and his staunch support of the cause of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas was the main cause of the overthrow of the  Kauravas. On several critical occasions, it was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's assistance and inventive mind that stood the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas in good stead. After the general destruction of the Y\u0101davas at Prabh\u0101sa, he was killed unintentionally by a hunter named  Jaras who shot him with an arrow  mistaking him at a distance for a deer. He had more than 16000 wives, but  Rukmini and Satyabh\u0101m\u0101, (as also R\u0101dh\u0101) were his favourites.
