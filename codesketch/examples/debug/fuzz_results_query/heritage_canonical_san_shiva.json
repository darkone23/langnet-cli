[RTL. 266] are sometimes regarded as forms of him; he is especially worshipped at Benares and has even more names than Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, one thousand and eight being specified in the 69th chapter of the \u015aiva-Pur\u0101\u1e47a and in the 17th chapter of the Anu\u015b\u0101sana-parvan of the Mah\u0101-bh\u0101rata, some of the most common being Mah\u0101-deva, \u015aambhu, \u015aa\u1e43kara, \u012a\u015ba, \u012a\u015bvara, Mahe\u015bvara, Hara; his sons are Ga\u1e47e\u015ba and K\u0101rttikeya), \u0100\u015bv\u015ar.; MBh.; K\u0101v. &c., RTL. 73",
