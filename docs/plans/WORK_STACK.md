# Work Stack Overview

## Current Focus Areas

| Area | Status | Immediate Next Step |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Universal Schema** | *Active* – plan created, directory added. | Implement `src/langnet/schema.py` dataclasses and update the `BaseBackendAdapter` to return them. |
| **Canonical Query Normalization** | Core pipeline passes tests; ASCII‑enrichment pending. | Add language detection for bare‑ASCII queries and integrate enrichment services (Heritage, CLTK, Whitaker’s). |
| **Heritage Encoding Strategy** | Smart detection works; `fetch_canonical_sanskrit` needs ranking & DICO URL extraction. | Refactor the function to collect all candidate links, rank them, and expose DICO URLs. |
| **Heritage Lark Parser Migration** | Not started. | Write Lark grammar for Heritage morphology HTML and replace the regex‑based parser. |
| **Pedagogy – P1/P2 Features** | P0 stable; citation display, fuzzy search, and CDSL enhancements pending. | Implement sense‑level citation rendering and fuzzy matching utilities. |
| **DICO Integration** | Design docs exist in `docs/plans/todo/dico/`; no code yet. | Scaffold `src/langnet/dico/` package, create collector & DB modules, and add ingestion pipeline. |
| **Normalization via `sktsearch`** | *Idea* – potential win for better canonical forms. | Implement `fetch_canonical_via_sktsearch` helper and integrate into normalization pipeline. |

## Recommended Order of Work

1. Universal Schema – establishes the contract for all back‑ends.
2. Heritage Encoding Strategy – improves canonical‑form handling.
3. Normalization via `sktsearch` – boosts recall before ASCII enrichment.
4. Canonical Query Normalization (ASCII enrichment).
5. Lark Parser Migration.
6. Pedagogy Enhancements (citation display, fuzzy search).
7. DICO Integration.

## How to Use This File

- Keep this file up‑to‑date as plans move between `active/`, `todo/`, and `completed/`.
- Refer to it when deciding which task to pick next; the table gives a quick snapshot of priority and readiness.
- When a plan is finished, move its markdown file to `docs/plans/completed/` and update the corresponding row to **Done**.
