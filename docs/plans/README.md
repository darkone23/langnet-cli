# Project Plans Overview

This repository organises its design and implementation plans under `docs/plans/` using clear lifecycle categories:

| Category | Directory | What it contains |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Active** | `docs/plans/active/` | Plans that are currently being worked on. They may have partially‑implemented code, ongoing tests, or upcoming milestones. |
| **Todo** | `docs/plans/todo/` | High‑level ideas, future work, or plans that have not yet started. |
| **Completed** | `/dev/null` | Once plans are completed they should be deleted |

---

### Maintenance Guidelines

1. **When a plan moves from active to completed** – move its markdown file to `docs/plans/completed/` and update this README.
2. **When a new high‑level idea appears** – add a markdown file under `docs/plans/todo/`.
3. **Avoid duplicate files** – each plan should live in only one of the three directories.
4. **Review implementation status** - Check if "active" plans are actually complete before updating.
5. **Keep structure clean** - Remove redundant files and directories.
6. **Track progress** - Update status markers (✅ COMPLETE, 🔄 IN PROGRESS, ⏳ PENDING) as work progresses.
